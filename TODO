## dev
if someone's completion system is not initialized, the bash direnv export thing will fail with `compdef not defined` sort of error
`just direnv_export_docker '.env.production.frontend' --params` can still silently fail

removing unused import, should catch this specifically

pull mailpit contents (we can't pull screeshots)
distribute tests across databases and redis https://pytest-xdist.readthedocs.io/en/stable/distribution.html
enable verbose debugging on tests when GHA debug is enabled
maybe screenshot comments? https://github.com/ActivityWatch/aw-webui/blob/291da6f2c5e7a6b896f23a4eec5ffed9874321ba/.github/workflows/comment.yml#L69
add console logs to log `page.on("console", lambda msg: print(f"Console Message: {msg.type()}: {msg.text()}"))`
add domains for services just/docker.just https://github.com/dvddarias/docker-hoster/blob/develop/hoster.py and https://github.com/costela/docker-etchosts

downside with this action is it requires write access to the repo and manages a separate branch. instead we should just add a coverage failure threshold.
```
      # TODO coverage data is not outputting properly right now
      # - name: Add Coverage Comment to PR
      #   id: coverage_comment
      #   uses: py-cov-action/python-coverage-comment-action@v3
      #   with:
      #     GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ github.token }}
```

https://github.com/tecolicom/actions-use-apt-tools/issues/4 - `sudo apt-get update` does work.

maybe use a different event loop? Faster / less issues with playwright?

```
# TODO this doesn't seem to fix the issue
# https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-pytest/issues/167#issuecomment-1546854047
# def pytest_configure():
#     log.info("pytest_configure: nesting asyncio loop")
#     nest_asyncio.apply()

# TODO we should look into uvloop if we end up doing async tests
# @pytest.fixture(scope="session")
# def event_loop_policy():
#     return uvloop.EventLoopPolicy()
```

## build
add gitleaks check to local lefthook and CI, add lefthook documentation to upstream readme. brew install gitleaks
another alternative is https://grok.com/share/bGVnYWN5_950e9cbf-036f-4398-b573-df889547b913
add nixpacks cache, waiting on comment from author about how to do this.
push to registry
switch to https://railpack.com/guides/running-railpack-in-production
pull azure build and push stuff into this
the build debug stuff doesn't work when there are spaces in the build args, this is also probably going to break with the new railpack system...

## act compat
https://github.com/catthehacker/docker_images/issues/138 - apt tool, still failing on apt-install but not because of missing packages
act --container-architecture linux/amd64 --job web
act --container-architecture linux/amd64 --env OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN="$OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN"

## vs code
file picker search for specific files even though they are in gitignore
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lolacod.exclude-format-on-save ignore ui components
