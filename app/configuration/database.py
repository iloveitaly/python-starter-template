    Run migrations within the current process.

    Migrating automatically introduces risk that an important migration happens without you watching it. However,
    it's up to the migration author to test their migration before merging it, so this shouldn't be an issue.

    Here's why you may want to do this:

    - The risk of *not* migrating automatically introduces additional manual steps for the developer, which is always risky.
    - When the new version of the application depends on a database migration, it's hard to *not* auto-migrate. Unless
      migrations are carefully staged so application code does not depend on them, you have to migrate before launching
      a new container depending on those migrations. If you don't, the container will fail and roll back, which makes
      it challenging to actually run the migration. You have to have a container that does not have readiness probes
      in place (which introduces another set of problems) in order to run the migration.
    - If we auto-migrate, migration logs are sent to the logging system. If you shell into a container and migrate
      manually, the migration status does not get persisted to the logging system.
    - Not all deployment platforms make it easy to run migrations in a container that has access to env vars.

    For this reason, while an application is simple and the database is small, we recommend auto-migrating on startup.
    We've experimented with a bunch of places to do this, and here's what we recommend:

    - Run this migration logic during the setup() call right after setup() is marked as run
    - Start the container ideally in a pre-start hook or as the entrypoint command. If this isn't possible, running it
      on container startup works, but will cause issues with liveness probes timing out for larger migrations.

    At one point, we implemented a distributed migration lock to wait on concurrent migrations. We removed this and moved
    to a migrations/env.py lock in postgres instead of a redis-based distributed lock. Here's why:

    - It required redis, which was another dependency in an environment that is often different than production
    - If the container was killed, the lock would not be released, which caused migrations to hang indefinitely on next
      deploy.
