"""
The react-router application is setup as a SPA. This logic configures the fast API server to serve the static SPA assets.

There are some nuances we need to consider:

* The generated SPA API client use a specific host for access. This changes depending
  on the environment. This means, in order to run integration tests on the application
  we need to build the assets in an environment distinct from production, with the right
  target host configured.

* In development, we don't want to statically serve the assets. We want to use live reloaded react for a fast dev loop.
  The logic here is only used in production and integration tests, which reduces the test coverage and makes this logic
  more risky.

* At-scale, it makes sense to host assets on a CDN. However, serving assets out of a single container simplifies the
  deployment process and should be performant enough for most applications.

Without these headers, the index.html response will be cached and therefore can easily serve stale content.
This did not cause issues on Chrome, but Safari heavily caches files without these directives. This seems to only
happen with static HTML (since all of the other assets are hashed based on their content).

For this reason, anytime we are serving static HTML, we should never cache the file. Instead, the client should pull it
on every page load since it (a) is very small and (b) mostly links out to other files (JS, CSS, etc), which we can safely cache.
