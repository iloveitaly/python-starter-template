    Returns a list of allowed hosts for this service.

    - When `with_scheme=True`, production hosts are prefixed with `https://`.

      match typical local setups and CORS expectations.
    - When `with_scheme=False`, bare hostnames are returned.
    - Common development hosts are automatically added when running in development.

    This function is used by:

    - CORS configuration (origins must include scheme and, for dev, may include ports)
    - Trusted host protection (FastAPI `TrustedHostMiddleware`)
    - Session/cookie domain selection (the first host in the list)

    Notes:

    - `ALLOWED_HOST_LIST` must contain bare hostnames only (no scheme, no path).
      If an entry begins with `http://`, it will be ignored and a warning logged.
    - Local development servers often run on arbitrary ports; CORS handling augments these
      values with a regex to allow any port for development hosts.
