# Python & React Router Project Template

This is an extremely opinionated web application template.

Here's some of the guiding principles in this stack:

1. Use popular tooling + languages. LLMs perform better, easier to find developers.
2. Full-stack integration tests. This includes HTTPS and production-build JS on CI.
3. Eliminate magic commands. Env vars, developer environments, infra, etc should all be documented in code.
4. Containerized builds.
5. Full-stack typing.
6. Use boring core technology. No fancy databases, no novel languages, no obscure frameworks.

## Tech Stack

Here's the stack:

* **Development lifecycle.** Justfile + [AI LLM Prompts](https://github.com/iloveitaly/llm-ide-prompts) + Direnv + Mise + Lefthook + Localias + 1Password for local development & secret configuration
* **Backend.** Uv + Ruff + Python + FastAPI + [ActiveModel](https://github.com/iloveitaly/activemodel) + SQLModel + SQLAlchemy + Alembic (migrations) + Celery (jobs) + [TypeId](https://github.com/akhundMurad/typeid-python) + Playwright + [Mailers](https://github.com/alex-oleshkevich/mailers) + Polyfactory.
* **Frontend.** Pnpm + TypeScript + React + Vite + Vitest + React Router (in SPA mode) + ShadCN + Tailwind + ESLint + Prettier + [HeyAPI](https://heyapi.dev)
* **Services.** Postgres + Redis + [Mailpit](https://mailpit.axllent.org) + Docker Compose for running it all on dev + CI.
* **Observability.** Sentry + Clerk (user management) + PostHog + JSON structured logging.
* **Build.** Docker + [nixpacks](https://nixpacks.com/docs/getting-started) for containerization
* **CI/CD.** GitHub Actions for CI/CD
* **Deployment.** Up to you: anything that supports a container.

## Cost of Complexity

This is not a simple application template.

There are many things I don't like about this setup. There's a complexity cost and I'm not sure if it's worth it. It's definitely not for the faint of heart and solves very specific problems I've experienced as codebases and teams grow.

Modern web development is all about tradeoffs. Here are the options as I see them:

1. Use Rails, HotWire, etc.
   1. You lose React, all of the amazing UI libraries that come with it, the massive JS + Py labor market, great tooling (formatting, linting, etc), typing (Sorbet is not great), 1st class SDKs for many APIs (playwright, for example), and better trained LLMs.
   2. You get a battle-tested (Shopify! GitHub!) beautifully crafted batteries-included framework.
   3. You get a really beautiful language (I think Ruby is nicer than Python).
2. Use full stack JavaScript/TypeScript.
   1. You have to work with JavaScript everyday. I've given up on backend JavaScript. The whole ecosystem is a mess and I don't enjoy working in it. Non-starter for me. A personal preference and hill I'll die on.
   2. You get access to a massive labor market, great tooling, typing, and well-trained LLMs.
3. Use Python & React.
   1. You lose simplicity. You have to deal with two languages, which means more complex build systems and additional cognitive load.
   2. You lose a single beautifully crafted stack and instead have to stitch together a bunch of different tools (even if they are well-designed independently). Python's ecosystem is mature but not cohesive like Rails (no, Django is not even close).
   3. You get full-stack typing (if you do it right).
   4. You get access to the great tooling ([static analysis](https://astral.sh), amazing LLM performance, [great REPL tooling](https://github.com/iloveitaly/dotfiles/blob/a18fd4b0745877cfa03de2736caa39af49525afa/.python-functions#L4-L32)) on both Python and JavaScript.
   5. You can move fast with React and all of the [amazing](https://ui.shadcn.com) [UI](https://www.chakra-ui.com) libraries built on top of it, without having to deal with full stack JavaScript.
   6. You get access to massive JS + Py labor markets.

This template uses #3.

### Why I Hate JavaScript

JavaScript was built for the browser. Certain design decisions cannot be undone. The downstream impacts of this core decision cause development velocity to decrease over time with JavaScript:

1. No REPL that can handle `await`, which makes the repl unusable (you can't debug or tinker with any async code!)
2. No stack traces in async functions, make debugging prod code impossible.
3. Everything is evented. This means there are no threads + processes, which makes properly modelling an application in your head more complicated and limits the number of tools you have (i.e. no ability to easily fork an application, compared to Python)
4. Poor package quality. A bit more qualitative, but the average JS package has more poor code quality compared to Py. Additionally there are completely different ways of packing JS (ESM, UMD, etc) which cause weird package compatibility issues depending on how your TypeScript is configured.
5. Additional layers of indirection. You run JS but write TS. This creates many downstream issues (node stack traces don't match up with your filesystem, without a translation layer)
6. No centralization. Too many JS frameworks with not enough mindshare. The community cannot agree on a golden path (or four) and this really degrades the entire ecosystem.

There are good reasons why I should be fine with the above limitations, but I've tried to love JavaScript and I just don't. I hate it. I want to minimize my encounter with it in my development life, which is the main reason I'm choosing python for the backend here instead of JavaScript.

## Getting Started

There are a couple of dependencies which are not managed by the project:

* zsh. The stack has not been tested extensively on bash.
* [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev)
* docker (or preferably [OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev))
* 1Password. You'll want the native macOS client for CLI integration.
* Latest macOS
* VS Code

(you **could** use a different setup (bash, vim, etc), but this is not the golden path for this project.)

[Copier](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is the easiest way to get started. It allows you to clone this project, automatically customize the important pieces of it, and most importantly *stay up to date* by pulling upstream changes.

Create a new folder with your package name (this makes it easier to infer the package name from the folder name via copier scripts):

```shell
mkdir your-project
cd your-project
```

Then run the copier script to set up the package:

```shell
# shell extensions help copier infer github username, etc. Not required if you want to do that yourself.
uv tool run --with jinja2_shell_extension copier@latest copy \
  --trust --vcs-ref=HEAD https://github.com/iloveitaly/python-package-template .
```

The neat thing about copier is [you can pull updates](.copier/update.sh) from this template later on:

```shell
uv tool run --with jinja2_shell_extension copier update --trust --skip-tasks --skip-answered
```

If you want to skip updates in a particular directory ('web' in this case):

```shell
uv tool run --with jinja2_shell_extension copier update --trust --skip-tasks --skip-answered --exclude web
```

Once you've copied the template and have the above dependencies installed, you can run:

```shell
mise install
just setup
```

That should do most of what you need. Here are some bits you'll need to handle manually:

* [Install the shell hooks for a couple tools](#shell-completions). Direnv is especially important.
* If you use 1password for secrets, [you'll need to set up the 1Password CLI.](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/)

### Simple Mode

If you despise dev productivity tooling you can avoid using:

* direnv
* 1password
* mise
* localias
* docker

Here's what you need to do:

1. Make sure you have `just` installed. You'll need this.
2. Make sure you install the [right versions](./.tool-versions) of python, node, and pnpm.
3. Make sure you setup redis + postgres locally in whatever way you want and set the `DATABASE_URL` and `REDIS_URL` variables to match your setup.
4. Instead of using `just dev` you'll need to run `just js_dev` and `just py_dev` in separate terminals.
5. Get a `.env` file you can just `source` using your terminal
   1. Adjust the host-related environment variables to match how you are going to host it locally
   2. [You may run into some cookie-related issues](https://github.com/iloveitaly/python-starter-template/blob/fd4af0a93587f211816b276ba5ff9211cdfbab34/app/routes/middleware/__init__.py#L97-L108)

If you are working on a team, ask a friend who has the system fully configured to run:

```shell
just direnv_bash_export
```

If you don't have a teammate with the full setup, you will need 1Password CLI and direnv to run this successfully.

Then, you can simply source the resulting file when you create a new shell session:

```shell
source .env.yourname.local
```

The primary downside to this approach is:

* Any mutated API keys from 1Password will not be automatically updated. You'll need to update these manually.
* Updated ENV configuration will not be automatically used. You need to manage sourcing.
* You'll need to manually update your env for tests, if you need to use different configuration ([this is done automatically for you](tests/direnv.py))
* Some cookie issues and https-related problems since you aren't using a real domain (probably some workarounds here, but I haven't tried)

### Advanced Mode

There are some extra goodies available if you are adventurous:

```shell
just requirements --extras
```

### Shell Completions

Here are a couple additions to your shell environment that you'll probably want to make:

* [direnv](https://direnv.net/docs/hook.html)
* [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/cli/completion.html)
* [just](https://just.systems/man/en/shell-completion-scripts.html)
* [fzf tab completion](https://github.com/Aloxaf/fzf-tab) (this makes working with just really nice)

## Usage

The following are poorly-organized notes about various pieces of the system.

### Package Dependencies

Non-language dependencies are always tricky. Here's how it's handled:

* `brew` is used to install tools required by development scripts
* `mise` is used for runtimes, package managers (uv, pnpm), and runners (direnv + just). Mise should be used to install any tools required for running `build*` and `test*` Justfile recipes but not tools that are *very* popular (like jq, etc) which are better installed by the native os package manager.
  * Note that `asdf` could probably be used instead of `mise`, but I haven't tested it and there's many Justfile recipes that use mise.
* `apt` is used to install *some* of the tools required to run CI scripts (like zsh), but most are omitted since they should never run in production.
* Direct install scripts are used to install some more obscure packages (localias, nixpacks, etc) that are not well supported by the os package manager or mise.

### JavaScript Code Organization

Here's how frontend code is organized in `web/app/`:

* `lib/` not specific to the project. This code could be a separate package at some point.
* `utils/` project-specific code, but not specific to a particular page.
* `helpers/` page- or section-specific code that is not a component, hook, etc.
* `hooks/` react hooks.
* `configuration/` providers, library configuration, and other setup code.
* `components/` react components.
  * `ui/` reusable ShadCN UI components (buttons, forms, etc.).
  * `shared/` components shared across multiple pages.
  * create additional folders for route- or section-specific components.

### Python Test Code Organization

* `tests/**/utils.py` is for test-specific code that is not a fixture or a factory.
* `tests/factories.py` all factories should go here.
* `tests/**/assertions.py` all custom `assert_*` functions should go here.
* `tests/**/conftest.py` is for test-specific fixtures. This is the only place you should put fixtures.
* `tests/{commands,routes,jobs,models}/` map to corresponding application categories under `app/`.

### Public Directories

There are two public directories in the project:

* `public/` is not used in development. During the build process, bundled javascript is copied here and served using [[app/routes/static.py]]. This is excluded from git.
* `web/public` is used in development *and* production. This is where the vite dev server serves static files from. Files included here are tracked by git and bundled by vite into the production assets.

### Toggling GitHub Actions

It's helpful, especially when you are conserving GH actions credits and tinkering with your build setup, to sometimes disable GitHub actions.

The easiest way to do this is with the CLI:

```shell
gh workflow disable # and `enable` to turn it back on
```

### Python Data Factories

I tried both [factoryboy](https://factoryboy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) and [polyfactory](https://github.com/litestar-org/polyfactory/) and landed on polyfactory for a couple reasons:

* Integration with SQLAlchemy + Pydantic
* Type inference. It looks at the types defined on the pydantic model (including sqlmodel!) and generates correct values for you. This is really nice.

There are some significant gaps in functionality, but the maintainers [have been open to contributions.](https://github.com/litestar-org/polyfactory/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Ailoveitaly)

### Python Debugging Extras

I'm a big of installing many debugging tools locally. These should not be installed in the production build.

I've included my favorites in the `debugging-extras` group. These are not required for the project to run.

### Naming Recommendations

General recommendations for naming things throughout the system:

* Longer names are better than shorter names.
* All lowercase GitHub organizations and names. Some systems are case sensitive and some are not.
* All 1password fields should be hyphen-separated and not use spaces.

### Pytest Organization & Tooling

* [pretty-traceback](https://github.com/mbarkhau/pretty-traceback/pull/17) is used to clean up the horrible-by-default pytest stack traces that make life difficult.
* Since `tests/` is in the top-level of the project, `__init__.py` is required.
* All fixtures should go in `conftest.py`. Importing fixtures externally [could break in future versions.](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.4.x/how-to/fixtures.html#using-fixtures-from-other-projects)
* Transactional database cleaning is used for all non-integration tests.

### Pytest Formatting

The default pytest output is terrible. Here's what I'd like:

1. I want the start and end of a test to be clearly identified with `tests/integration/settings_test.py::test_example_note_upload` style formatted test identifier
2. When a test fails, I want the logs for that test to be outputted, and then a marker that the test has completed. Even better, if we could dump the captured logs to a file instead/in addition to, that would be helpful
3. The default stacktrace for exceptions raised during a test is very obnoxious. I want cleanly formatted stack traces with `pretty-traceback`
4. I want a table of the tests which take the longest to run.
5. I want to be able to enable "live logging" so log output is streamed to my terminal (in color)
6. Code coverage output

Options investigated:

* https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pytest-pretty
* https://github.com/Teemu/pytest-sugar

### Pytest Clerk

Integrations test that include auth are critical. Otherwise you aren't testing your entire app. Both integration and route tests hit the live Clerk API.

However, there's some pretty intense playwright trickery to make everything work. Clerk has bot protections in place, so to avoid getting caught, you need to mutate the URLs used to include a signed key.

This is done by `setup_clerk_testing_token`. If you want to remove the custom playwright routing, you can do so using `teardown_clerk_testing_token`.

### Database Migrations

1. SQLModel provides a way to push a model definition into the DB. However, once columns and not tables are mutated you must drop the table and recreate it otherwise changes will not take effect. If you develop in this way, you'll need to be extra careful.
2. If you've been playing with a model locally, you'll want to `just db_reset` and then generate a new migration with `just db_generate_migration`. If you don't do this, your migration may work off of some of the development state.
3. The database must be fully migrated before generating a new migration. Run `just db_migrate` otherwise you will get an error.

### Production Database Migrations

By default, [automatic migrations are enabled on deploy](https://github.com/iloveitaly/python-starter-template/blob/7df59f9b0d3e3f9221646cb717bf0e77a8febfee/app/configuration/database.py#L35-L37).

If you want to disable and migrate manually, here's what you need to do:

1. Deploy the new version of the application
2. Open up a shell on a production container
3. Run `alembic upgrade head`

### Application Lifecycle Commands

All commands to control and operate the application are in the [Justfile](./Justfile). Across `py`, `js`, and `db` the following 'subcommands' are supported:

* `clean`. Wipe all temporary files related to the environment.
* `setup`. Set up the environment.
* `nuke`. Clean & setup.
* `play`. Interactive playground.
* `lint`. Run linting.
* `lint`-fix. Run linting and fix all errors.
* `test`. Run tests.
* `dev`. Run the development server.

There are top-level commands for many of these (`clean`, `setup`, `dev`, etc) which run actions for all environments.

### Linting

The more linting tools the better, as long as they are well maintained, useful, and add value. I think of linters as helpful teammates that let me know when I missed something.

This project implements many linting tools (including DB SQL linting!). This could cause developer friction at some point, but we'll see how this scales as the codebase complexity grows.

### Test Database Cleaning

This is implemented by `activemodel` which is a package created specifically for this project.

Two methods are needed:

* Transaction. Used whenever possible. If you create customize secondary engines outside the context of `activemodel` this will break.
* Truncation. Transaction-based cleaning does not work is database mutations occur in a separate process.
  * This gets tricky because of platform differences between macOS and Linux, but the tldr is although it's possible to share a DB session handle between the test process *and* the uvicorn server running during integration tests, it's a bad idea with lots of footguns, so we opt for truncation on integration tests (which require a separate server process to run).

### General Testing Architecture

Here's how this project thinks about tests:

* The test environment should mirror production as closely as possible and for higher level tests (integration or smoke tests) we should put in extra engineering effort to get there. Accept additional complexity in integration tests to mirror the production environment more closely.
* All core application workflows should be covered with an integration test. I think of an integration test as a browser-based test using production-built javascript/HTML.
* Most common flows should be covered by a functional test. I think of a functional test as e2e tests on specific API routes or jobs. Primarily testing backend logic and not interaction with the UI.
* Unit tests should be used for tricky code or to validate regressions.

### Integration Testing (Playwright)

Everyone calls integration testing something different. To me, integration tests are:

* Few in number, since they are expensive, slow, and brittle.
* Use the production configuration as much as possible. This means production JS build, HTTPS, etc.
* Cover the main workflows of the application to provide automated QA against the most important pieces of the application.
* Provide self-documentation about what the system does.

Here are some tips for working with the Playwright integration tests.

Log the DOM structure:

```python
screen.debug()
```

Pause playwright execution:

```python
page.pause()
```

### 'Login As' Admin Functionality

This is an important part of any production application. Being able to impersonate a user and view their application to debug issues.

* The user table has a role field
* After logging in, set the user to `admin` and you'll be able to switch users.

### React Router Routes

Here's a more complex example of how to define nested routes + layouts in react router 7:

```typescript
import type { RouteConfig } from "@react-router/dev/routes"
import { index, layout, prefix, route } from "@react-router/dev/routes"

export default [
  index("routes/index.tsx"),
  layout("layouts/authenticated.tsx", [
    ...prefix("intake", [
      layout("layouts/intake.tsx", [
        index("routes/intake/index.tsx"),
        route("/:id", "routes/intake/detail.tsx"),
      ]),
    ]),
    ...prefix("notes", [
      layout("layouts/notes.tsx", [
        index("routes/notes/index.tsx"),
        route(":id", "routes/notes/detail.tsx"),
      ]),
    ]),
    route("/settings", "routes/settings.tsx"),
  ]),
] satisfies RouteConfig
```

The `routes.ts` is meant to be a simple way to define routes configuration at a high level.
Unlike previous react router versions, loaders and other options are not available.

[We have a special handler in fastapi](app/routes/static.py) to serve the JS files when any route not defined explicitly
by FastAPI is requested. A "better" (and more complex) way to handle this is to deploy JS assets to a CDN and use a
separate subdomain for the API server. Keeping everything in a single docker container and application is easier
on deployment.

### Debugging Javascript Vite Build

Here's how to use `debugger` statements within vite code:

```shell
VITE_BUILD_COMMIT=-dirty node inspect web/node_modules/@react-router/dev/bin.js build
```

### Cookies & Sessions

* The FastAPI session middleware is setup so you can use cookies/sessions in your project.
* Subdomains are used for the API server instead of separate domains in test, so cookies can be shared between the API server and the web client.
* `same-origin` cookies are enforced in prod, but not in dev.

### Pytest Route Tests

* Use `api_app.url_path_for` for all URL generation.
* Not specific to route tests, but be aware of `faker`. It can generate invalid random data (like invalid zip codes, which can cause issues with automated tests on geocoding systems).

If you have separate domains used for app, api, etc you can build a fastapi client that sets the `Host` header to the correct domain:

```python
@pytest.fixture
def api_client():
    from app.server import api_app

    with TestClient(api_app, base_url="api.example.com") as client:
        yield client
```

### Pytest Integration Playwright Tests

<!-- TODO should merge with the section above -->

To debug integration tests, you'll want to see what's happening. Use `--headed` to do this:

```shell
pytd tests/integration/user_creation_test.py -k signup --headed
```

(find [pytd definition here](https://github.com/iloveitaly/dotfiles/blob/a4bd6c2c8f38b1f980fdb878bbf21c27918a5d05/.aliases#L98))

Note that `--headed` *does* change a lot of underlying Chrome parameters which can impact how the browser interacts
with the web page.

If a test fails, a screenshot *and* trace is generated that you can use to replay the session and quickly visually inspect what went wrong.

Instead of `breakpoint()` use this to debug and test the page:

```python
page.pause()
```

Some tips:

* Playwright has various verbose logging mechanisms. Check out `.env.dev.local-example` for more information.
* You can also use `--slowmo=500` to slow down playwright interactions so you can see what's going on.
* Specific versions of `playwright` are locked to specific chromium versions. This is done via a JSON file bundled into the package at `driver/package/browsers.json`
* If chromium does not open with `--headed` try restarting your VS Code, terminal, and if all else  fails computer. Sometimes things can get corrupted in the process hierarchy and cause it to fail.

Here's a video demonstrating how to debug a playwright test:

### Using Azure OpenAI

Azure's OpenAI services are great for new projects because they give you a ton of credits to play around with.

You can [easily switch from OpenAI to Azure OpenAI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/switching-endpoints). Here's the credentials you need to set:

```shell
export AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=does_not_start_with_sk-
# note that eastus2 seems to get newer models first
export AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://eastus2.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/
# not the same as the OAI versions
export OPENAI_API_VERSION=2025-03-01-preview
```

And in [`app/configuration/openai.py`](app/configuration/openai.py):

```python
from openai import AzureOpenAI

openai = AzureOpenAI()
```

Other notes:

* [Here's a list of models you can use](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models?tabs=global-standard%2Cstandard-chat-completions#model-summary-table-and-region-availability)
* The model names must match the deployment names. You have to manage this yourself. [Checkout this terraform example.](./infra/azure/openai.tf)
* [Here's a list of API versions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/reference#rest-api-versioning)

### Python Commands

This project uses the "commands" pattern. This goes my many names (interactor, etc). All files within `app/commands/` are
programmatically enforced to have a `perform` method that can take any number (or no!) arguments.

### Production Console

You need a REPL to operate a production application. There's a nice one bundled with the application:

```shell
./console.py
```

### TypeID for Database Primary Keys

From my time at Stripe, I became a big fan of IDs with metadata about the object they represent. There's a great project, TypeID, which has implemented this across a bunch of languages. I've adopted it here.

If you are used to UUIDs instead of `int` primary keys, it can feel a little strange, but the benefits are huge:

1. TypeIDs tell you what kind of ID they are
2. TypeIDs are effectively base32 encoded UUIDs with a suffix. UUIDs are just as fast as int primary keys and don't take up much more space.
3. Never getting a bad join (if you join the wrong table, there will be no results, because uuids never collide)
4. Ability to pregenerate IDs clientside

The biggest downsides are:

* Ergonomics of a large, hard-to-memorize ID vs a smaller one.
* You can't plop TypeIDs right into a raw SQL query. You need to translate them to a UUID ([or use `typeid_parse`](https://github.com/iloveitaly/python-starter-template/blob/7df59f9b0d3e3f9221646cb717bf0e77a8febfee/migrations/versions/2025_03_27_489aff797e2e_add_typeid_sql_helpers.py#L1))

In order to eliminate some of these ergonomics:

1. [Check out the type ID raycast package](https://www.raycast.com/jmaeso/uuid-generator)
2. [ActiveModel](https://github.com/iloveitaly/activemodel) has a couple of helpers to improve the DX

### Secrets

The secret management in this template is more complex that it seems like it should be. The primary reason behind this is to avoid secret drift at all costs and to document in code all secrets, for all environments.

Here's the issues I'm trying to avoid:

* Different developers have *slightly* different secrets that create a "works on my machine" problem.
* New secrets are not automatically integrated into local (or CI) environments causing the project to break on CI and
  and dev machines when a new environment variable is introduced.
* Cumbersome and undocumented CI & production secret management. I want a single command to set secrets on CI & prod
  without any thinking or manual intervention. I want there to be a single source of truth for all secrets.

Solving these problems adds more complexity to the developer experience. We'll see if it's worth it.

Secret management is handled in a couple of different places:

* `.env*` files which source secrets from 1password using `op read`
* `just secrets_*` which generate 1password connection tokens and set them on CI
* `just direnv_*` to dump secret state in various scenarios

Most likely, you'll need to bootstrap your secret management by manually setting your account + vault
in order to generate a connection token:

```shell
OP_ACCOUNT=company.1password.com OP_VAULT_UID=a_uuid just secrets_local-service-token
```

And drop the resulting token in your `.env.local` file. This credential will expire every 90 days.

One thing to be careful of dependent environment variables. If
you have a variable that depends on another variable pulled from 1Password, you'll want to set an empty default value.

### DevProd

Here are the devprod principles this project adheres to:

* There should be no secret scripts on a developers machine. Everything to setup and manage a environment should be within the repo. I've chosen a Justfile for this purpose.
* The entire lifecycle of a project should be documented in code. Most of the time, this means Justfile recipes.

### Deployment

* Containers should be used instead of proprietary build systems (Heroku, etc).
* Ability to build production-identical containers locally for debugging
* Container building and registry storage should be handled on CI. This reduces vendor lock in.

### Procfile

The good old Procfile is still used in this repo. I like Procfiles, they are a great way to define exactly what the main production
entrypoints of an application are.

They are used in two ways:

1. [[Procfile]] defines the main production entrypoints of the application
2. `just dev` generates a `Procfile.dev` which is used for local development. This file is not checked in to git. This enables a bunch of development services to be run and managed by a single command (foreman)

Isn't there anything better than `foreman`? Unfortunately, no. Foreman hasn't been touched in a long time, but it's still the best:

* hivemind does not ignore terminal clear control sequences. This means certain commands (like JavaScript build watchers) will randomly clear the terminal, which drives me nuts.
* ultraman looks to have some obvious bugs. Could be worth checking into in the future again.

### Python Job Queue

I tried both RQ and Celery, and looked at other job queue systems, before landing on Celery.

#### Celery

* Job scheduling is handled in the same process as job execution, which is a terrible idea in large-scale systems.
* `celery-types` contains a bunch of type stubs that fix most of the typing issues
* Spawn is not natively supported and fork has been depreciated https://github.com/celery/celery/issues/6036#issuecomment-1151224775

#### RQ

I *really* liked the idea of [RQ as a job queue](https://python-rq.org). The configuration and usage seemed much more simple.

However, it didn't work for me.

* [Did not work on macOS](https://github.com/rq/rq/issues/2058)
* [Spawn workers were not supported](https://github.com/rq/rq/pull/2176) and I ran into strange issues when running subprocesses.
* The fastapi dashboard is pretty terrible. I don't want to waste time building a dashboard.
* There is no exponential backoff built in.

At this point, I gave up trying and switched to celery. The big downside with celery is there's no way to run Flower
inside an existing application (you can't bolt it on to a fastapi server) so you'll need an entirely separate container
running the flower application.

Here's the Procfile command that worked for RQ:

```yml
worker: rq worker --with-scheduler -w rq.worker.SpawnWorker
```

[I've left some of the configuration around](./app/rq.py) in case you want to try it out.

### App Recommendations

* TablePlus via Set App is a great database workbench
* `httpie` has a great desktop app for API testing
* Raycast + UUID extension is great for helping with type IDs

## Production

### Frontend

* `window.SENTRY_RELEASE` has the commit sha of the build.
* Backend uses JSON logging in production
* `devDependencies` should only contain dependencies that are required for local development. All dependencies required
  for building the frontend should be in `dependencies`.

### Backend

#### Installing Additional Packages

Because of this glitch in nixpacks, it's not straightforward to install packages on nixpacks:

```shell
apt-get update
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib apt-get install nano
```
