prompt = "Focus on all unit + command tests (`pytest --exclude tests/integration`). Make sure they pass and fix errors. If you run into anything very odd: stop, and let me know. Mutate test code first and let me know if you think you should update application code.\n\nThen, focus on integration tests in tests/integration. If an integration test fails, run it again just to be sure it wasn't a flakey test (integration tests are not deterministic). If it fails because of a visual error, check the 'tmp/test-results/playwright/' directory for a screenshot relating to the failing test that you can inspect.\n\nFor additional debugging help, view the development version of the site at `$PYTHON_TEST_SERVER_HOST` using a browser.\n\nDo not attempt to perform this task in a sandbox. Service connections require access to host networking.\n\nIf you get stuck or seem to be in a loop, give me a short summary of exactly where you are running into trouble, let me know, and stop working.\n\nDo not attempt to solve these issues:\n\n* `just`, `direnv`, and `js_build` should always run or exist.\n* Chromium/Chrome/playwright not working properly.\n* Postgres, Redis, or other service connection errors.\n\nIf you run into errors, stop immediately and let me know with a summary of the problem.\n"
