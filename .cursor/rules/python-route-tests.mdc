## Python Route Tests


- Polyfactory is the [factory](tests/factories.py) library in use. `ModelNameFactory.build()` is how you generate factories.
- Use `assert_status(response)` instead of `assert response.status_code == status.HTTP_200_OK`
- Do not reference routes by raw strings. Instead, use the typed route helpers defined in `app/generated/fastapi_typed_routes.py`.
